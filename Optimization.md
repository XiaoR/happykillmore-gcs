# Optimization #

Depeding upon your laptop's processing power, you may notice some serious lag in update rates. There are 5 things you can do to increase the speed of the GCS.

1) Reduce your rates in the serial tab. On a "fast" system, I recommend 10Hz for Attitude, 5Hz for GPS and 3Hz for Waypoints. On a "slow" system, I recommend 4Hz for Attitude, 3Hz for GPS and 2Hz for Waypoint.

2) Reduce your Google Earth update rate. Click File, Settings, Google Earth and select 1Hz or 2Hz for your map update rate.

3) Disable Smoothing for both instruments and 3D model. Click File, Settings, Instruments and uncheck both smoothing checkboxes.

4) Reduce the number of instruments. Click File, Settings, Instruments and disable more instruments. The 3D Model is the biggest processor hog.

5) Buy a new laptop...seriously...that thing's from like 1987.....
